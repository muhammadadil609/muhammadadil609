# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Muhammad Adil

I'm a master's student at Duke University, pursuing a degree in Quantitative Management â€“ Business Analytics. I specialize in data science, marketing analytics, and strategic problem-solving using tools like Python, R, and SQL.

I'm passionate about using data to solve business problemsâ€”from pricing strategy to customer behavior prediction. My experience spans multiple industries including gaming, e-commerce, and retail, where I've applied segmentation, predictive modeling, and machine learning to drive insights and growth.
